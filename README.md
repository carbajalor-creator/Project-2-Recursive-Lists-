Collaboration & Sources
For this project I looked back on lab 5 and recursive list problems we did in class and used some of the logic for those functions for these new ones. I went on geeksforgeeks.org to see if there was a quick way to remove atoms from a list for functions like shape and remove. I used AI to help me figure out what errors I was encountering meant and how I could fix them like car and cdr errors.

Implementation Details
For my design I initially went over all the functions and made base cases for them. Then I wrote what recursive calls would be needed and if any were similar to a function that I had already implemented. For example the flat function, after I implemented that I realized I could also use it for other functions that needed to search for atoms in a list and it's much easier to search for an atom in a flat list than one with nested lists.

Testing & Status
All the functions in my program work. I was able to test them with all the lists that were provided from sampleInputForRecLists.txt. I tested most of my functions as I made them and then went over them again one last time with different lists to make sure they worked as expected.
